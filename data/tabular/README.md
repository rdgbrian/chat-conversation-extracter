# Tabular Data (Private)

This folder is used to store tabular message datasets for analysis.

**Note:** The original CSV files containing message data are not included in this public repository to protect participant privacy.

If you're looking to reproduce the analysis:
- Use your own dataset in the same format `time,phone_number,message_content`
- Or refer to the synthetic examples in `data/example/` (if applicable)

Each CSV file originally contained messages with metadata (e.g., timestamps, phone numbers), which have since been anonymized or removed in downstream processing.
